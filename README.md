# Surfs Up Analysis

# Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to collect additional information about temperature trends before W. Avy decides to open the surf and ice cream shop. Specifically, they wanted temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

1) Differences in Average Temperature

    - The difference in the average temperature was approximately 4 degrees. The average temperature was higher in June, where the average temperature in June was 75 degrees compared to 71 degrees in December.

2) Differences in Range, Min, Max

    - The difference in the range of temperatures between the two months was only 6 degrees, as the range in June was 21 degrees and the range in December was 27 degrees.

    - The difference in the maximum temperatures between the two months was only 2 degrees, as the maximum temperature in June was 85 degrees while the maximum in December was 83 degrees.

    - The difference in the minimum temperatures the two months was only 8 degrees, as the minimum temperature in June was 64 degrees and the minimum temperature in December was 56 degrees.

3) Differences across quartiles

    - The differences in temperatures were slightly higher in June than December across the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, where June was 4, 4, and 3 degrees higher, respectively.

# Summary

- Despite what initial assumptions might have existed about opening a surf and ice cream shop in December, results from the analysis reveal only marginal differences in temperatures across a range of summary statistics when comparing June to December. W. Avy should not expect much of an effect from the June/December temperatures in Oahu on his surf and ice cream shop.

- Additional Queries to Pursue

    1) Gather the remaining temperature data across the remaining 10 months and compare each month by their summary statistics to determine if the temperature in the remaining months will affect the business.

    2) Gather the precipitation data across all 12 months and compare each month by their summary statistics to determine if the precipation in certain months will affect the business.
